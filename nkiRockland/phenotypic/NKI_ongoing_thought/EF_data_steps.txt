removed 10 participants with missing data
removed 8 multivariate outliers
replaced 10 outliers with the median for vigilance and visual attention
replaced 4 extreme values with the median for working memory
replaced 6 extreme values with the median for word memory
ran PCA with varimax on EF data: suggested between 2 and 5 components
ran PCA with 3 components: added meaningful components and used all items, suggests good fit
removed face memory due to cross-loading
ran with four components: new component only consisted of 1 item, suggests 3 is good
removed face memory due to cross-loading
now third component only consists of single item: ran 2 component solution
removed vigilance and visual attention due to not loading on either component and re-ran: got nice solution, saved variables
ran MV tests to assess effect of adding EF to thought by age effects
performed oblimin to check correlation between components: 0.308, stuck with varimax for ease of interpretation
checked whether the relationship between age and factor 7 might be moderated by executive function: seems appropriate for mediation
