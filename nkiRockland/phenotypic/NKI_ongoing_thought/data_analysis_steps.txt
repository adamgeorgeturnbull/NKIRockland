n=652, 43 multivariate outliers removed
14 extreme values replaced with median for guilt question
25 extreme values replaced with median for angry question
decided to remove anger question due to lack of variance
14 extreme values replaced with median for sad question
decided to remove guilt question due to lack of variance
checked for collinearity, no real issues
sad variable removed due to low SMC and variance
PCA with varimax suggests a 6 factor solution
PCA with oblimin shows highest correlation is .4 between components, will re-evaluate to determine rotation
chose to run varimax again with 7 components: gave additional components defined by multiple questions over .6, or 3 or more over .45, so this number was chosen
7 factor rotated matrix was used to identify cross-loaders, that loaded on 3 components, or were not separated by more than .2 from highest loading to next: possible future interaction, personal worries, near future, family members, important, distant future
re-ran, clear sense of purpose cross-loads and was removed, as did earlier today
re-ran oblimin and it showed many pairs of factors that correlated chose 7 factor oblimin solution as final
re-checked for cross-loaders: interactions that took place in, long time friends, recent past, place close to, current worries
new solution had recent past alone, removed and re-ran with 6 factor solution: final
saved scores and ran t-tests across age groups, and MV analyses with cognitive failures, RAVLT, and IQ
