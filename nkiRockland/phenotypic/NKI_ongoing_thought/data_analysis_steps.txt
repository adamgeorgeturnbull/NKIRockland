n=652, 43 multivariate outliers removed
14 extreme values replaced with median for guilt question
25 extreme values replaced with median for angry question
decided to remove anger question due to lack of variance
14 extreme values replaced with median for sad question
decided to remove guilt question due to lack of variance
checked for collinearity, no real issues
sad variable removed due to low SMC and variance
PCA with varimax suggests a 6 factor solution
PCA with varimax with 7 and 8 components still adds meaningful components
PCA with 9 components adds component with single item over .6: 8 is correct
PCA with oblimin shows highest correlation is .35 between components, will re-evaluate to determine rotation
Re-run without near future, distant future, or sense of purpose: didn't load more than .6 on any component
Re-run without interaction, recent past, longtime friends, place close to, important, family members, possible future interaction as they loaded >.4 on more than 4 questions
Correlations not strong: ran with varimax
Re-ran without earlier today: loaded less than .6 on any and >.4 on two
Reduced to 7 factors as final factor only composed of one item
Checked correlations with oblivion: highest .334 and rest below .32
Chose varimax 7 component solution as final
