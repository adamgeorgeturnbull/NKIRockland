n=693
4 participants removed for missing data
n=689
Multivariate outliers calculated as having a probability of MAH distance <.001
46 multivariate outliers removed
n=643
Guilty and angry questions identified as being borderline for skewness and kurtosis
46 extreme values replaced with median for guilt question
decided to remove guilt question due to lack of variance (493 participants answered 1, rest were extreme values)
decided to remove anger question due to lack of variance (515 participants answered 1)
58 extreme values replaced with median for sad question
Ran unrotated PCA to check for singularity: lowest eigenvalue was .093
Got SMC numbers to check for multicollinearity: highest value .836, lowest .190
sad variable removed due to low SMC and variance
PCA with varimax suggests a 6 factor solution
PCA with varimax with 7 components still adds meaningful components
PCA with varimax with 8 components still adds meaningful components item over .6
PCA with varimax with 9 components produces component with only one question over .45
Suggests 8 is correct
Family members removed due to complexity, near future removed due to not loading on any factor
Distant future removed due to not loading on any factor
Changed to 7 factors as final factor now only contained 1 item
Removed personal worries as it didn't load on any factor
Oblimin rotation showed 5 factor pairs that correlated >.32, decided to use varimax for ease of interpretation
